[VERSE 1: TOP LEFT TIER]
On the left side up top, start with U all alone,
Next wheel has I and O, like "I owe" on the phone,
Third wheel spins R and E, they're ready to explore,
Top left's got U, I, O, R, E - that's four!

[VERSE 2: TOP RIGHT TIER]
Right side top, here's the trick: A, T, L, N,
J, Y, S join the mix - remember this my friend:
"A Tall Ninja Jumps, Yes Sir!" - the phrase you need to know,
Seven letters spinning round, across the top row!

[VERSE 3: BOTTOM LEFT - Upper Wheel]
Lower down on the left, the upper wheel's a treat:
V, M, K, C - "Very Merry Kangaroos Cheat!"
Four letters in a cluster, spinning clockwise through the air,
V-M-K-C - say it with flair!

[VERSE 4: BOTTOM LEFT - Lower Wheel]
Right below that wheel is G, W, Z,
"Great White Zebras" swimming in the sea,
Three letters on the left, they're easy as can be,
G, W, Z - just repeat after me!

[VERSE 5: BOTTOM RIGHT - Upper Wheel]
On the right side lower half, the top wheel's got a crew:
P, F, H, D - "Pink Fluffy Hamsters Dance" for you!
Four letters spinning counter, from the top they start to fall,
P-F-H-D - remember them all!

[VERSE 6: BOTTOM RIGHT - Lower Wheel]
Final wheel, the bottom right, we've got X, B, Q,
"Xylophones Bring Quiet tunes" - that's what they do!
Three letters end our journey, in the corner they reside,
X, B, Q - you've got the whole device inside!

[FINAL CHORUS - RECAP]
From U-I-O-R-E on left, to A-T-L-N-J-Y-S,
Down to V-M-K-C and G-W-Z with no mess!
P-F-H-D and X-B-Q complete the scene,
Twenty-six letters spin in wheels - you'll know just what I mean!
